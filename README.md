# üåü X-Ray Image Summary Prediction using ViT + GPT-2

This project leverages cutting-edge AI architectures, **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **GPT-2**, to generate concise and insightful summaries for X-Ray images. Designed to assist in medical diagnostics, this model creates descriptions of visible structures and abnormalities directly from image inputs.

## üöÄ Features
- **State-of-the-Art Vision Transformer (ViT):** Extracts detailed visual features from X-Ray images.
- **GPT-2 Text Generator:** Creates comprehensive textual summaries from visual data.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Seamless integration of image processing and text generation.
- **Advanced Preprocessing:** Enhances X-Ray image clarity for superior feature extraction.

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** >= 3.8
- **PyTorch**
- **Transformers Library** (Hugging Face)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook** *(optional)*

### Install Dependencies

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ViT-GPT2-Project.git
cd ViT-GPT2-Project
```

### Step 2: Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open the notebook `test-vit-gpt2.ipynb` for a guided walkthrough of the pipeline:

```bash
jupyter notebook test-vit-gpt2.ipynb
```

### Step 3: Load Pretrained Models

- Download pretrained weights from Hugging Face:
  - [ViT Models](https://huggingface.co/models?search=vit)
  - [GPT-2 Models](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gpt2)

### Step 4: Train or Fine-Tune

- Load your dataset of X-Ray images and their corresponding summaries.
- Train or fine-tune the model using the integrated pipeline.
- Evaluate its performance on test data.
